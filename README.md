# towerblock

[Demo ->](https://sebawael1.github.io/towerblock/)

I used in my project (Tower Block) 
- HTML -JS and CSS 
I use HTML to add the Score, the instructions, game-over, messages, and much more I used it also to connect the files of (style.css, script.js) 
I used in JS (object, if statement, this keyword, classes, and much more)
Ultimately I used CSS to add the styles 

I hope you like it!
